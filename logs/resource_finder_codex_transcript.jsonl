Use when conducting literature review, searching for related work, finding baseline papers, or looking for methodology references.\n---\n\n# Paper Finder\n\nSystematic paper discovery and prioritization for research projects.\n\n## When to Use\n\n- Starting a literature review\n- Looking for related work on a topic\n- Finding baseline papers for experiments\n- Searching for methodology references\n- Building a citation list for a research paper\n\n## How to Use\n\nRun the helper script from your workspace:\n\n```bash\npython .claude/skills/paper-finder/scripts/find_papers.py \"your research topic\"\n```\n\nOptions:\n- `--mode fast` (default): Quick search\n- `--mode diligent`: Thorough search (recommended for comprehensive review)\n- `--format json`: Output as JSON instead of text\n\nExample:\n```bash\npython .claude/skills/paper-finder/scripts/find_papers.py \"hypothesis generation with large language models\" --mode fast\n```\n\n## Search Strategy\n\n### Query Formulation\n\nUse structured queries for better results:\n\n1. **Core concept + Method**: \"transformer attention mechanism\"\n2. **Problem + Domain**: \"few-shot learning natural language processing\"\n3. **Technique + Application**: \"graph neural networks drug discovery\"\n\n### Multi-Stage Search\n\n1. **Broad scan**: Start with general topic terms\n2. **Focused dive**: Use specific method/technique names from initial results\n3. **Citation chase**: Search for highly-cited papers referenced in relevant work\n\n## Citation Prioritization\n\n### Relevance Tiers\n\n| Relevance Score | Priority | Action |\n|-----------------|----------|--------|\n| 3 (High) | Must read | Download PDF, read fully, cite |\n| 2 (Medium) | Should read | Read abstract + intro, cite if relevant |\n| 1 (Low) | Optional | Skim abstract, cite only if needed |\n| 0 (Not relevant) | Skip | Do not include |\n\n### Citation Count Thresholds\n\n| Category | Citation Count | Interpretation |\n|----------|----------------|----------------|\n| Seminal | 1000+ | Foundational work, must cite |\n| Well-established | 100-999 | Widely accepted, cite if relevant |\n| Recent/Emerging | 10-99 | Current research, cite for novelty |\n| New | <10 | Very recent, check publication venue |\n\n### Venue Tiers (ML/AI Focus)\n\n**Tier 1** (Top venues, high credibility):\n- NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, EMNLP, CVPR, ICCV\n\n**Tier 2** (Strong venues):\n- AAAI, IJCAI, NAACL, COLING, ECCV, WACV\n\n**Tier 3** (Good venues):\n- *ACL workshops, COLM, EACL, CoNLL\n\n**Preprints** (arXiv):\n- Check for peer-reviewed version first\n- Cite arXiv only if no published version exists\n\n## Screening Workflow\n\n### Phase 1: Title Screening\n- Review titles from search results\n- Mark papers as \"include\", \"exclude\", or \"maybe\"\n- Goal: ~50% reduction\n\n### Phase 2: Abstract Screening\n- Read abstracts for included/maybe papers\n- Evaluate: relevance, methodology, findings\n- Goal: Identify key papers for deeper reading\n\n### Phase 3: Full-Text Review\n- Download and read full PDFs for key papers\n- Extract: methods, results, limitations, citations\n- Use the PDF chunker for detailed reading (see below)\n\n## Output Structure\n\nReturns relevance-ranked papers with:\n- Title, authors, year\n- Abstract (already extracted)\n- URL for download\n- Relevance score (0-3, focus on papers with score >= 2)\n- Citation count\n\n## After Finding Papers\n\n1. Download PDFs for papers with relevance >= 2\n2. Read abstracts first (already provided in output)\n3. Only read full PDFs for most relevant papers\n4. Write notes to literature_review.md immediately\n5. Track citations for references.bib\n\n## Reading Large PDFs\n\nUse the PDF chunker to split papers into smaller PDF files that can be read directly.\nThis preserves all formatting perfectly (unlike text extraction which loses formatting).\n\n**Dependencies:**\n```bash\n# Using uv (recommended):\nuv add pypdf\n\n# Or with pip:\npip install pypdf\n```\n\n**How to run:**\n\n```bash\npython .claude/skills/paper-finder/scripts/pdf_chunker.py <pdf_path>\n```\n\nOptions:\n- `--pages-per-chunk N`: Number of pages per chunk (default: 1)\n- `--output-dir DIR`: Output directory (default: `<pdf_dir>/pages`)\n\n**Output:**\n- Creates PDF chunk files: `<pdf_name>_chunk_001.pdf`, `<pdf_name>_chunk_002.pdf`, etc.\n- Creates a manifest: `<pdf_name>_manifest.txt` listing all chunks with page ranges\n\n**Integration with screening workflow:**\n1. Run the chunker on papers before detailed reading\n2. For abstract skimming: read only chunk 1 (page 1 or pages 1-3)\n3. For deep reading: read ALL chunk PDFs sequentially, writing notes after each\n4. Check the manifest to see how many chunks exist\n5. IMPORTANT: Do not skip chunks - methodology and results are in later chunks\n\n## If Paper-Finder Service Not Running\n\nThe script will show a fallback message. Use manual search instead:\n- arXiv: https://arxiv.org\n- Semantic Scholar: https://www.semanticscholar.org\n- Papers with Code: https://paperswithcode.com\n- Google Scholar: https://scholar.google.com\n\nManual search works well - paper-finder is just a convenience for faster, more targeted results.\n\n## References\n\nSee `references/` folder for:\n- `search_strategies.md`: Detailed search query formulation\n- `prioritization_guide.md`: Extended prioritization criteria\n","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}

Faiss is *optional* for GPU users - though Faiss-GPU will greatly speed up nearest neighbor search - and *highly recommended* for CPU users. Faiss can be installed using \"conda install faiss-cpu -c pytorch\" or \"conda install faiss-gpu -c pytorch\".\n\n## Get evaluation datasets\nTo download monolingual and cross-lingual word embeddings evaluation datasets:\n* Our 110 [bilingual dictionaries](https://github.com/facebookresearch/MUSE#ground-truth-bilingual-dictionaries)\n* 28 monolingual word similarity tasks for 6 languages, and the English word analogy task\n* Cross-lingual word similarity tasks from [SemEval2017](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2017/task2/)\n* Sentence translation retrieval with [Europarl](http://www.statmt.org/europarl/) corpora\n\nYou can simply run:\n\n```bash\ncd data/\nwget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/arrival/vectors.tar.gz\nwget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/arrival/wordsim.tar.gz\nwget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/arrival/dictionaries.tar.gz\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can also download the data with:\n\n```bash\ncd data/\n./get_evaluation.sh\n```\n\n*Note: Requires bash 4. The download of Europarl is disabled by default (slow), you can enable it [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/MUSE/blob/master/data/get_evaluation.sh#L99-L100).*\n\n## Get monolingual word embeddings\nFor pre-trained monolingual word embeddings, we highly recommend [fastText Wikipedia embeddings](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/pretrained-vectors.html), or using [fastText](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText) to train your own word embeddings from your corpus.\n\nYou can download the English (en) and Spanish (es) embeddings this way:\n```bash\n# English fastText Wikipedia embeddings\ncurl -Lo data/wiki.en.vec https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fasttext/vectors-wiki/wiki.en.vec\n# Spanish fastText Wikipedia embeddings\ncurl -Lo data/wiki.es.vec https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fasttext/vectors-wiki/wiki.es.vec\n```\n\n## Align monolingual word embeddings\nThis project includes two ways to obtain cross-lingual word embeddings:\n* **Supervised**: using a train bilingual dictionary (or identical character strings as anchor points), learn a mapping from the source to the target space using (iterative) [Procrustes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_Procrustes_problem) alignment.\n* **Unsupervised**: without any parallel data or anchor point, learn a mapping from the source to the target space using adversarial training and (iterative) Procrustes refinement.\n\nFor more details on these approaches, please check [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.04087.pdf).\n\n### The supervised way: iterative Procrustes (CPU|GPU)\nTo learn a mapping between the source and the target space, simply run:\n```bash\npython supervised.py --src_lang en --tgt_lang es --src_emb data/wiki.en.vec --tgt_emb data/wiki.es.vec --n_refinement 5 --dico_train default\n```\nBy default, *dico_train* will point to our ground-truth dictionaries (downloaded above); when set to \"identical_char\" it will use identical character strings between source and target languages to form a vocabulary. Logs and embeddings will be saved in the dumped/ directory.\n\n### The unsupervised way: adversarial training and refinement (CPU|GPU)\nTo learn a mapping using adversarial training and iterative Procrustes refinement, run:\n```bash\npython unsupervised.py --src_lang en --tgt_lang es --src_emb data/wiki.en.vec --tgt_emb data/wiki.es.vec --n_refinement 5\n```\nBy default, the validation metric is the mean cosine of word pairs from a synthetic dictionary built with CSLS (Cross-domain similarity local scaling). For some language pairs (e.g. En-Zh),\nwe recommend to center the embeddings using `--normalize_embeddings center`.\n\n### Evaluate monolingual or cross-lingual embeddings (CPU|GPU)\nWe also include a simple script to evaluate the quality of monolingual or cross-lingual word embeddings on several tasks:\n\n**Monolingual**\n```bash\npython evaluate.py --src_lang en --src_emb data/wiki.en.vec --max_vocab 200000\n```\n\n**Cross-lingual**\n```bash\npython evaluate.py --src_lang en --tgt_lang es --src_emb data/wiki.en-es.en.vec --tgt_emb data/wiki.en-es.es.vec --max_vocab 200000\n```\n\n## Word embedding format\nBy default, the aligned embeddings are exported to a text format at the end of experiments: `--export txt`. Exporting embeddings to a text file can take a while if you have a lot of embeddings. For a very fast export, you can set `--export pth` to export the embeddings in a PyTorch binary file, or simply disable the export (`--export \"\"`).\n\nWhen loading embeddings, the model can load:\n* PyTorch binary files previously generated by MUSE (.pth files)\n* fastText binary files previously generated by fastText (.bin files)\n* text files (text file with one word embedding per line)\n\nThe two first options are very fast and can load 1 million embeddings in a few seconds, while loading text files can take a while.\n\n## Download\nWe provide multilingual embeddings and ground-truth bilingual dictionaries. These embeddings are fastText embeddings that have been aligned in a common space.\n\n### Multilingual word Embeddings\nWe release fastText Wikipedia **supervised** word embeddings for **30** languages, aligned in a **single vector space**.\n\n| | | | | | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Arabic: [*text*](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/arrival/vectors/wiki.multi.ar.vec) | Bulgarian: [*text*](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/arrival/vectors/wiki.multi.bg.vec) | Catalan: [*text*](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/arrival/vectors/wiki.multi.ca.vec) | Croatian: [*text*](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/arrival/vectors/wiki.multi.hr.vec) | Czech: [*text*](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/arrival/vectors/wiki.multi.cs.vec) | Danish: [*text*](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/arrival/vectors/wiki.multi.da.vec)\n| Dutch: [*text*](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/arrival/vectors/wiki.multi.nl.vec) | English: [*text*](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/arrival/vectors/wiki.multi.en.vec) | Estonian: [*text*](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/arrival/vectors/wiki.multi.et.vec) | Finnish: [*text*](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/arrival/vectors/wiki.multi.fi.vec) | French: [*text*](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/arrival/vectors/wiki.multi.fr.vec) | German: [*text*](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/arrival/vectors/wiki.multi.de.vec)\n| Greek: [*text*](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/arrival/vectors/wiki.multi.el.vec) | Hebrew: [*text*](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/arrival/vectors/wiki.multi.he.vec) | Hungarian: [*text*](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/arrival/vectors/wiki.multi.hu.vec) | Indonesian: [*text*](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/arrival/vectors/wiki.multi.id.vec) | Italian: [*text*](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/arrival/vectors/wiki.multi.it.vec) | Macedonian: [*text*](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/arrival/vectors/wiki.multi.mk.vec)\n| Norwegian: [*text*](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/arrival/vectors/wiki.multi.no.vec) | Polish: [*text*](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/arrival/vectors/wiki.multi.pl.vec) | Portuguese: [*text*](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/arrival/vectors/wiki.multi.pt.vec) | Romanian: [*text*](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/arrival/vectors/wiki.multi.ro.vec) | Russian: [*text*](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/arrival/vectors/wiki.multi.ru.vec) | Slovak: [*text*](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/arrival/vectors/wiki.multi.sk.vec)\n| Slovenian: [*text*](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/arrival/vectors/wiki.multi.sl.vec) | Spanish: [*text*](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/arrival/vectors/wiki.multi.es.vec) | Swedish: [*text*](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/arrival/vectors/wiki.multi.sv.vec) | Turkish: [*text*](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/arrival/vectors/wiki.multi.tr.vec) | Ukrainian: [*text*](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/arrival/vectors/wiki.multi.uk.vec) | Vietnamese: [*text*](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/arrival/vectors/wiki.multi.vi.vec)\n\nYou can visualize crosslingual nearest neighbors using [**demo.ipynb**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/MUSE/blob/master/demo.ipynb).\n\n\n### Ground-truth bilingual dictionaries\nWe created **110 large-scale ground-truth bilingual dictionaries** using an internal translation tool.

In *Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing*, pages 2289-2294.\n\nThe package includes a script to build cross-lingual word embeddings with or without parallel data as described in the papers, as well as evaluation tools in word translation induction, word similarity/relatedness and word analogy.\n\nIf you use this software for academic research, [please cite the relevant paper(s)](#publications).\n\n\nRequirements\n--------\n- Python 3\n- NumPy\n- SciPy\n- CuPy (optional, only required for CUDA support)\n\n\nUsage\n--------\n\nIn order to build your own cross-lingual word embeddings, you should first train monolingual word embeddings for each language using your favorite tool (e.g. [word2vec](https://github.com/tmikolov/word2vec) or [fasttext](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText)) and then map them to a common space with our software as described below. Having done that, you can evaluate the resulting cross-lingual embeddings using our included tools as discussed next.\n\n#### Mapping\n\nThe mapping software offers 4 main modes with our recommended settings for different scenarios:\n\n- **Supervised** (recommended if you have a large training dictionary):\n```\npython3 map_embeddings.py --supervised TRAIN.DICT SRC.EMB TRG.EMB SRC_MAPPED.EMB TRG_MAPPED.EMB\n```\n- **Semi-supervised** (recommended if you have a small seed dictionary):\n```\npython3 map_embeddings.py --semi_supervised TRAIN.DICT SRC.EMB TRG.EMB SRC_MAPPED.EMB TRG_MAPPED.EMB\n```\n- **Identical** (recommended if you have no seed dictionary but can rely on identical words):\n```\npython3 map_embeddings.py --identical SRC.EMB TRG.EMB SRC_MAPPED.EMB TRG_MAPPED.EMB\n```\n- **Unsupervised** (recommended if you have no seed dictionary and do not want to rely on identical words):\n```\npython3 map_embeddings.py --unsupervised SRC.EMB TRG.EMB SRC_MAPPED.EMB TRG_MAPPED.EMB\n```\n\n`SRC.EMB` and `TRG.EMB` refer to the input monolingual embeddings, which should be in the word2vec text format, whereas `SRC_MAPPED.EMB` and `TRG_MAPPED.EMB` refer to the output cross-lingual embeddings. The training dictionary `TRAIN.DICT`, if any, should be given as a text file with one entry per line (source word + whitespace + target word).\n\nIf you have a NVIDIA GPU, append the `--cuda` flag to the above commands to make things faster.\n\nFor most users, the above settings should suffice. Choosing the right mode should be straightforward depending on the resources available: as a general rule, you should prefer the mode with the highest supervision for the resources you have, although it is advised to try different variants in case of doubt.\n\nIn addition to these recommended modes, the software also offers additional options to adjust different aspects of the mapping method as described in the papers. While most users should not need to deal with those, you can learn more about them by running the tool with the `--help` flag. You can either use one of the recommended modes and modify a few options on top of it, or do not use any recommended mode and set all options yourself. In fact, if you dig into the code, you will see that the above modes simply set recommended defaults for all the different options.\n\n#### Evaluation\n\nYou can evaluate your mapped embeddings in bilingual lexicon extraction (aka dictionary induction or word translation) as follows:\n```\npython3 eval_translation.py SRC_MAPPED.EMB TRG_MAPPED.EMB -d TEST.DICT\n```\nThe above command uses standard nearest neighbor retrieval by default. For best results, it is recommended that you use CSLS retrieval instead:\n```\npython3 eval_translation.py SRC_MAPPED.EMB TRG_MAPPED.EMB -d TEST.DICT --retrieval csls\n```\nWhile better, CSLS is also significantly slower than nearest neighbor, so do not forget to append the `--cuda` flag to the above command if you have a NVIDIA GPU.\n\nIn addition to bilingual lexicon extraction, you can also evaluate your mapped embeddings in cross-lingual word similarity as follows:\n```\npython3 eval_similarity.py -l --backoff 0 SRC_MAPPED.EMB TRG_MAPPED.EMB -i TEST_SIMILARITY.TXT\n```\n\nFinally, we also offer an evaluation tool for monolingual word analogies, which mimics the one included with word2vec but should run significantly faster:\n```\npython3 eval_analogy.py -l SRC_MAPPED.EMB -i TEST_ANALOGIES.TXT -t 30000\n```\n\n\nDataset\n--------\nYou can use the following script to download the main dataset used in our papers, which is an extension of that of [Dinu et al. (2014)](http://clic.cimec.unitn.it/~georgiana.dinu/down/):\n```\n./get_data.sh\n```\n\n\nReproducing results\n--------\n\nWhile we always recommend to use the above settings for best results when working with your own embeddings, we also offer additional modes to replicate the systems from our different papers as follows:\n- **ACL 2018** (currently equivalent to the unsupervised mode):\n```\npython3 map_embeddings.py --acl2018 SRC.EMB TRG.EMB SRC_MAPPED.EMB TRG_MAPPED.EMB\n```\n- **AAAI 2018** (currently equivalent to the supervised mode, except for minor differences in re-weighting, normalization and dimensionality reduction):\n```\npython3 map_embeddings.py --aaai2018 TRAIN.DICT SRC.EMB TRG.EMB SRC_MAPPED.EMB TRG_MAPPED.EMB\n```\n- **ACL 2017** (superseded by our ACL 2018 system; offers 2 modes depending on the initialization):\n```\npython3 map_embeddings.py --acl2017 SRC.EMB TRG.EMB SRC_MAPPED.EMB TRG_MAPPED.EMB\npython3 map_embeddings.py --acl2017_seed TRAIN.DICT SRC.EMB TRG.EMB SRC_MAPPED.EMB TRG_MAPPED.EMB\n```\n- **EMNLP 2016** (superseded by our AAAI 2018 system):\n```\npython3 map_embeddings.py --emnlp2016 TRAIN.DICT SRC.EMB TRG.EMB SRC_MAPPED.EMB TRG_MAPPED.EMB\n```\n\n\nFAQ\n--------\n\n##### How long does training take?\n\n- The supervised mode (`--supervised`) should run in around 2 minutes in either CPU or GPU.\n- The rest of recommended modes (either `--semi_supervised`, `--identical` or `--unsupervised`) should run in around 5 hours in CPU, or 10 minutes in GPU (Titan Xp or similar).\n\n\n##### This is running much slower for me! What can I do?\n\n1. If you have a GPU, do not forget the `--cuda` flag.\n2. Make sure that your NumPy installation is properly linked to BLAS/LAPACK. This is particularly important if you are working on CPU, as it can have a huge impact in performance if not properly set up.\n3. There are different settings that affect the execution time of the algorithm and can thus be adjusted to make things faster: the batch size (`--batch_size`), the vocabulary cutoff (`--vocabulary_cutoff`), the stochastic dictionary induction settings (`--stochastic_initial`, `--stochastic_multiplier` and `--stochastic_interval`) and the convergence threshold (`--threshold`), among others. However, most of these settings will have a direct impact in the quality of the resulting embeddings, so you should not play with them unless you really know what you are doing.\n\n\n##### Prior versions of this software included nice scripts to reproduce the exact same results reported in your papers. Why are those missing now?\n\nAs the complexity of the software (and the number of publications/results to reproduce) increased, maintaining those nice scripts became very tedious. Moreover, with the inclusion of CUDA support and FP32 precision, reproducing the exact same results on different platforms became inviable due to minor numerical variations in the underlying computations, which were magnified by self-learning (e.g. the exact same command is likely to produce a slightly different output on CPU and GPU). While the effect in the final results is negligible (the observed variations are around 0.1-0.2 accuracy points), this made it unfeasible to reproduce the exact same results in different platforms.\n\nInstead of that, we now provide an [easy interface to run all the systems proposed in our different papers](#reproducing-results). We think that this might be even more useful than the previous approach: the most skeptical user should still be able to easily verify our results, while we also provide a simple interface to test our different systems in other datasets.\n\n\n##### The ablation test in your ACL 2018 paper reports 0% accuracies for removing CSLS, but I am getting better results. Why is that?\n\nAfter publishing the paper, we discovered a bug in the code that was causing those 0% accuracies. Now that the bug is fixed, the effect of removing CSLS is not that dramatic, although it still has a big negative impact. At the same time, the effect of removing the bidirectional dictionary induction in that same ablation test is slightly smaller.\n\n\nSee also\n--------\n\nVecMap is a basic building block of [Monoses](https://github.com/artetxem/monoses), our Unsupervised Statistical Machine Translation system. You can use them in combination to train your own machine translation model from monolingual corpora alone.\n\n\nPublications\n--------\n\nIf you use this software for academic research, please cite the relevant paper(s) as follows (in case of doubt, please cite the ACL 2018 paper, or the AAAI 2018 paper if you use the supervised mode):\n```\n@inproceedings{artetxe2018acl,\n  author    = {Artetxe, Mikel  and  Labaka, Gorka  and  Agirre, Eneko},\n  title     = {A robust self-learning method for fully unsupervised cross-lingual mappings of word embeddings},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)},\n  year      = {2018},\n  pages     = {789--798}\n}\n\n@inproceedings{artetxe2018aaai,\n  author    = {Artetxe, Mikel  and  Labaka, Gorka  and  Agirre, Eneko},\n  title     = {Generalizing and improving bilingual word embedding mappings with a multi-step framework of linear transformations},\n","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}

Monolingual language model pretraining (BERT)\nIn what follows we explain how you can download and use our pretrained XLM (English-only) BERT model. Then we explain how you can train your own monolingual model, and how you can fine-tune it on the GLUE tasks.\n\n### Pretrained English model\nWe provide our pretrained **XLM_en** English model, trained with the MLM objective.\n\n| Languages        | Pretraining | Model                                                               | BPE codes                                                     | Vocabulary                                                     |\n| ---------------- | ----------- |:-------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------:| --------------------------------------------------------------:|\n| English          |     MLM     | [Model](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/XLM/mlm_en_2048.pth)         | [BPE codes](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/XLM/codes_en)      | [Vocabulary](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/XLM/vocab_en)    |\n\nwhich obtains better performance than BERT (see the [GLUE benchmark](https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard)) while trained on the same data:\n\nModel | Score | CoLA | SST2 | MRPC | STS-B | QQP | MNLI_m | MNLI_mm | QNLI | RTE | WNLI | AX\n|:---: |:---: |:---: | :---: |:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n`BERT` | 80.5 | 60.5 | 94.9 | 89.3/85.4 | 87.6/86.5 | 72.1/89.3 | 86.7 | 85.9 | 92.7 | 70.1 | 65.1 | 39.6\n`XLM_en` | **82.8** | **62.9** | **95.6** | **90.7/87.1** | **88.8/88.2** | **73.2/89.8** | **89.1** | **88.5** | **94.0** | **76.0** | **71.9** | **44.7**\n\nIf you want to **play around with the model and its representations**, just download the model and take a look at our **[ipython notebook](https://github.com/facebookresearch/XLM/blob/master/generate-embeddings.ipynb)** demo.\n\nOur **XLM** PyTorch English model is trained on the same data than the pretrained **BERT** [TensorFlow](https://github.com/google-research/bert) model (Wikipedia + Toronto Book Corpus). Our implementation does not use the next-sentence prediction task and has only 12 layers but higher capacity (665M parameters). Overall, our model achieves a better performance than the original BERT on all GLUE tasks (cf. table above for comparison).\n\n### Train your own monolingual BERT model\nNow it what follows, we will explain how you can train a similar model on your own data.\n\n### 1. Preparing the data\nFirst, get the monolingual data (English Wikipedia, the [TBC corpus](https://yknzhu.wixsite.com/mbweb) is not hosted anymore).\n```\n# Download and tokenize Wikipedia data in 'data/wiki/en.{train,valid,test}'\n# Note: the tokenization includes lower-casing and accent-removal\n./get-data-wiki.sh en\n```\n\n[Install fastBPE](https://github.com/facebookresearch/XLM/tree/master/tools#fastbpe) and **learn BPE** vocabulary (with 30,000 codes here):\n```\nOUTPATH=data/processed/XLM_en/30k  # path where processed files will be stored\nFASTBPE=tools/fastBPE/fast  # path to the fastBPE tool\n\n# create output path\nmkdir -p $OUTPATH\n\n# learn bpe codes on the training set (or only use a subset of it)\n$FASTBPE learnbpe 30000 data/wiki/txt/en.train > $OUTPATH/codes\n```\n\nNow **apply BPE** tokenization to train/valid/test files:\n```\n$FASTBPE applybpe $OUTPATH/train.en data/wiki/txt/en.train $OUTPATH/codes &\n$FASTBPE applybpe $OUTPATH/valid.en data/wiki/txt/en.valid $OUTPATH/codes &\n$FASTBPE applybpe $OUTPATH/test.en data/wiki/txt/en.test $OUTPATH/codes &\n```\n\nand get the post-BPE vocabulary:\n```\ncat $OUTPATH/train.en | $FASTBPE getvocab - > $OUTPATH/vocab &\n```\n\n**Binarize the data** to limit the size of the data we load in memory:\n```\n# This will create three files: $OUTPATH/{train,valid,test}.en.pth\n# After that we're all set\npython preprocess.py $OUTPATH/vocab $OUTPATH/train.en &\npython preprocess.py $OUTPATH/vocab $OUTPATH/valid.en &\npython preprocess.py $OUTPATH/vocab $OUTPATH/test.en &\n```\n\n### 2. Train the BERT model\nTrain your BERT model (without the next-sentence prediction task) on the preprocessed data:\n\n```\n\npython train.py\n\n## main parameters\n--exp_name xlm_en                          # experiment name\n--dump_path ./dumped                       # where to store the experiment\n\n## data location / training objective\n--data_path $OUTPATH                       # data location\n--lgs 'en'                                 # considered languages\n--clm_steps ''                             # CLM objective (for training GPT-2 models)\n--mlm_steps 'en'                           # MLM objective\n\n## transformer parameters\n--emb_dim 2048                             # embeddings / model dimension (2048 is big, reduce if only 16Gb of GPU memory)\n--n_layers 12                              # number of layers\n--n_heads 16                               # number of heads\n--dropout 0.1                              # dropout\n--attention_dropout 0.1                    # attention dropout\n--gelu_activation true                     # GELU instead of ReLU\n\n## optimization\n--batch_size 32                            # sequences per batch\n--bptt 256                                 # sequences length  (streams of 256 tokens)\n--optimizer adam_inverse_sqrt,lr=0.00010,warmup_updates=30000,beta1=0.9,beta2=0.999,weight_decay=0.01,eps=0.000001  # optimizer (training is quite sensitive to this parameter)\n--epoch_size 300000                        # number of sentences per epoch\n--max_epoch 100000                         # max number of epochs (~infinite here)\n--validation_metrics _valid_en_mlm_ppl     # validation metric (when to save the best model)\n--stopping_criterion _valid_en_mlm_ppl,25  # stopping criterion (if criterion does not improve 25 times)\n--fp16 true                                # use fp16 training\n\n## bert parameters\n--word_mask_keep_rand '0.8,0.1,0.1'        # bert masking probabilities\n--word_pred '0.15'                         # predict 15 percent of the words\n\n## There are other parameters that are not specified here (see train.py).\n```\n\nTo [train with multiple GPUs](https://github.com/facebookresearch/XLM#how-can-i-run-experiments-on-multiple-gpus) use:\n```\nexport NGPU=8; python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=$NGPU train.py\n```\n","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}
