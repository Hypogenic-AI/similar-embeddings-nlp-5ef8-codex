  title: Do words with similar meanings in different languages have similar embeddings
  domain: nlp
  hypothesis: 'Words with similar meanings in different languages will have similar
    embeddings in multilingual models. If words have multiple meanings, and only one
    meaning is similar across languages while others are not, it is unclear whether
    their embeddings will still be similar.

    '
  background:
    description: Nowadays models are able to handle vocabularies from multiple languages.
      If two words have pretty similar meanings in different languages, they might
      have similar embeddings as well. One follow-up question is, if the words have
      multiple meanings, and one of the meanings is pretty similar but others are
      not, will the embedding still be similar?
